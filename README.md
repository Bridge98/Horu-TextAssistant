# Horu (Text Assistant)
A simple text assistant made in Go, inspired by Jarvis (A Vocal Assistant Python);

## The idea:
the project was born while attending uni and wanted to be a first attempt with a solid coding project related wiith the first concepts of automation, completely made in golang.

[Horu - Arduino](https://github.com/Bridge98/Horu-TextAssistant/tree/main/HW-Horu)
[Horu - Golang](https://github.com/Bridge98/Horu-TextAssistant/tree/main/SW-Horu)

the idea is to make an interaction between arduino and a possible Raspberyy integration
